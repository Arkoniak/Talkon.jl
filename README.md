# Talkon
Bot for mutual help
We will create a Telegram group dedicated to help refugees from Ukraine. The volunteers will register and enter the type of help they can provide, the spoken languages, area of residence or any other relevant information. The refugee or his assistant will formulate and assign the type of problem and the bot would send the requests to the relevant persons. After accepting request volunteers and refugee using bot would be connected to a temporary group for a chat or audio/video call to discuss the problem.
